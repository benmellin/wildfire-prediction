# wildfire-prediction
## A final class project where we focused on predicting wildfires using NASA DAV data.
- My contributions to the project are in this repository. 
- I first identified positive instances of wildfire in the United States using [The National USFS Fire Occurrence Point Database](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-usfs-fire-occurrence-point-feature-layer-d3233). My work can be seen in the the [data cleaning notebook](Data_cleaning.ipynb). 
- Another group member used my instances of wildfire to pull NASA DAV (satellite) data from the points in time and space that were identified as positive wildfire occurances. He also generated negative instances of wildfire randomly, and verified them to ensure no wildfire did occur (thank you Nathan!).
- I then built, tuned and evaluated a decision tree on this dataset. Feature importance was also evaluated. My work on this can be seen in the [decision tree notebook] (decisiontree.ipynb)
